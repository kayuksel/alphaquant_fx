# LLM-Driven Scientific Discovery Technical Strategies for Forex

## Overview

This repository implements a novel, adaptive technical indicator discovered through an LLM-driven scientific discovery workflow. The indicator synthesizes multi-horizon momentum, volatility regime detection, tail-risk adjustment, and Gaussian-weighted trend filtering to generate a normalized trading signal for the AUDNZD currency pair on hourly OHLCV data.

## Results

Below is the equity curve generated by applying this strategy to AUDNZD hourly data:



## Experimental Setup

- **Instrument:** AUDNZD FX pair
- **Data Frequency:** Hourly OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)

## Strategy Description

1. **Volatility Regime Detection**

   - Measures recent volatility over a rolling window (up to 20 periods) and benchmarks against the cross-sectional median.
   - Classifies each asset into high/low volatility regimes to adapt weighting and memory parameters.

2. **Adaptive Decay Parameter**

   - Calculates `d_param` by combining standardized volatility deviation and regime flag.
   - Controls the exponential decay rates used when weighing past returns, emphasizing recent observations under high-volatility regimes.

3. **Multi-Window Momentum with Tail Risk**

   - Evaluates momentum across windows from 10 to 60 hours using exponential decay weights to focus on more recent returns.
   - Computes Conditional Value at Risk (5% CVaR) for each window to quantify downside risk.
   - Blends momentum and tail risk via an exponential penalty on extreme moves, then aggregates across windows using inverse-variance weighting.

4. **Gaussian-Weighted Trend Filters**

   - Applies three Gaussian kernels (fast, medium, slow) over the full return history to isolate trend bifurcations.
   - Bandwidths adapt dynamically based on volatility regime and return skewness, capturing asymmetric market conditions.

5. **Cross-Sectional Skew Adjustment**

   - Generates a ranking signal by comparing the latest return to the median of all assets (here only AUDNZD).
   - Scales signal by asset skewness to account for asymmetric return distributions.

6. **Aggregation & Normalization**

   - Multiplies the multi-window momentum, trend-filter score, and cross-sectional rank signals.
   - Applies a cubic root to control dispersion, then transforms via a sigmoid with a steepness factor of 10 to map into [0,1].

7. **Application to AUDNZD Hourly Data**

   - Hourly backtest shows stable equity growth with controlled drawdowns.
   - Captures both mean-reversion in low-volatility periods and trend-following in breakout regimes.
